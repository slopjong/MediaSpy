== ROADMAP ==
=============

========
v1.0:

* initial non-blank info view
* extracting film titles from file names (tough one if files are not properly named)
* basic settings handling
* clean and simple gui
* basic filtering

DONE :
* scanning user-chosen directories to find media files (films in a first time)
* create a list of these names in a database
* get films information (duration, plot, cover) from imdb
* display films list and information of the selected one
* browsing and searching film database (+ adding/deleting obviously)
* color code for movie state (OK, no info from imdb, unreadable, etc.) ?


========
v2.0 and upper:

* subtitle downloader
* playlist manager
* get bigger covers than imdb
* loaning manager
* stats collector (total duration, which one has been already seen, etc.)
* import/export filters (html, pdf)
* automatic new files inclusion (directory survey)
* music album and video series handling
* dvd handling
